# Day-Planner

An application that allows the user to document and save their plans for the day. 

The application uses the Date function which creates a user friendly interface that shows the user what hour has still available to make plans for and what hour has passed.

The plans are saved into the local storage, allowing the user to exit out of the application and then return with thier plans saved.
